
Bias-Variance notes (short):
- Logistic Regression tends to have lower variance and can be biased if model is not flexible enough to separate classes.
- k-NN with k small (e.g., 1) -> low bias, high variance; with larger k -> higher bias, lower variance.
- PCA reduces dimensionality and may reduce variance (helps with overfitting) but may increase bias if informative features are discarded.
